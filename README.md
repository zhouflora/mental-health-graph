# mental-health-graph

This project explores the relationship between age and a select few mental health disorders. 
I have parsed the data from a Canadian Community Mental Health Survey CSV to plot a line chart of the average 
amount of people suffering from a specific mental health disorder in each of the chosen age group ranges.

More information about the project & the actual code can be found in the .IPYNB file; the CSV is also attached for reference in the folder.
